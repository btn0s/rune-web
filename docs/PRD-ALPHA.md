# Visual Behavior Design for React Components

Rune is a visual development environment that brings the expressive power of Unreal Engine Blueprints to React component design. It's built for designers and design engineers who want to create rich, interactive components by expressing behavior visually - no translation, no loss of intent. 

By combining Figma's design capabilities with a powerful visual behavior system, you can create sophisticated React components with the full expressive power of code - all through an intuitive graph interface. See your ideas come to life as you design complex interactions, state management, and data flows visually, then export production-ready TypeScript that's ready to use in any React project.

## Core Features

### 1. Figma Import & Component Generation
- **What it does**: Transforms Figma designs into interactive components
- **Why it's important**: Starts with production-quality design as your foundation
- **Key benefits**:
  - Direct import from Figma files
  - AI-powered component generation
  - Automatic React component scaffolding
  - Maintained connection to design source

### 2. Visual Behavior System
- **What it does**: Express any component behavior through an intuitive graph interface
- **Why it's important**: Design complex interactions visually while maintaining the full power of code
- **Key benefits**:
  - Think visually about logic and flow
  - Express ideas without translation
  - Full power of code in visual form
  - See and test changes instantly
  - Build with confidence and speed

### 3. Complete Component Capabilities
- **What it does**: Design every aspect of modern React components visually
- **Why it's important**: No limits - express any behavior your component needs
- **Key capabilities**:
  - Rich State Design: Local state, global state, derived values
  - Event Systems: User interactions, custom events, complex flows
  - Effects & Lifecycle: Data loading, subscriptions, cleanup
  - Conditional Flows: Dynamic rendering, complex logic
  - Data Handling: Transformations, filtering, validation
  - Performance: Optimizations, memoization, refs

### 4. Interactive Development
- **What it does**: Provides immediate feedback as you design behavior
- **Why it's important**: See and test your components in real-time
- **Key benefits**:
  - Live preview of interactions
  - Visual flow tracing
  - State and prop inspection
  - Time-travel through states
  - Continuous evolution of ideas

### 5. AI-Powered Code Generation
- **What it does**: Intelligently translates visual graphs into optimized React code
- **Why it's important**: Get production-ready components that match your exact intent
- **Key benefits**:
  - Smart interpretation of graph behavior
  - Clean TypeScript code generation
  - Optimal implementation patterns
  - Immediate production readiness
  - Iterative refinement support
