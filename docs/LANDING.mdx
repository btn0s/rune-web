AI is enabling a new kind of builder—someone who can command both the visual language of design and the logical flow of engineering with the power of intent. As these tools evolve, we're seeing teams transform, increasingly made up of builders who move seamlessly from ideas to execution.

We're building Rune for this builder, for this future—where mockups don't get thrown over walls, where translation gaps disappear, and where unified creative processes move as fast as ideas themselves.

## Our Vision

A single, living canvas where product, design, and engineering collaborate in real time—where visual thinking and technical implementation naturally converge, producing the software we envision together.

## Introducing Rune

Rune combines the precision and design-first mindset of Figma, the interactive, node-based logic of Unreal Blueprints, and the AI-powered code generation of Cursor into a single, unified workspace.

*   **Design:** Master visual composition with intuitive vector and frame tooling, build with comprehensive component libraries, and ensure adaptability with responsive constraints. Optimized for design speed and clarity.
*   **Prototype:** Bring your designs to life with first-class logic, data, and state. Model interactions visually, similar to Unreal Blueprints, with deep integration for real-time iteration and feedback.
*   **Build:** Seamlessly transition from intent to implementation with LLM-powered code generation. Transform your high-level designs and prototypes into production-ready software, effortlessly.

Together, these capabilities create a true source of truth for modern software, eliminating handoffs and bridging the gap between design and production code.

## Why Now?

Three shifts in how we build software make this the perfect moment for Rune:

*   **The Rise of the Full-Stack Creator:** Teams are increasingly built around individuals who can own the entire product journey—from pixels to production. These builders need tools that match their capabilities.
*   **AI as a Creative Partner:** AI isn't just automating tasks—it's becoming a collaborative tool that amplifies human intent and creativity, enabling new ways of expressing ideas.
*   **The End of Handoffs:** Modern teams can't afford the friction of traditional workflows. They need environments where creation and implementation happen in the same space, at the same time.
