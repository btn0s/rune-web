# Visual Behavior Design for React

Build expressive, production-ready React components through an intuitive visual canvas. Rune brings the creative freedom of Unreal Engine Blueprints to your everyday React workflowâ€”closing the gap between design and implementation.

## Sketch. Connect. Ship.

Start with frames from Figma or a blank slate. Drag connections, tweak states, and see your component come alive instantly. No translation loss, no hand-offsâ€”just pure creative flow.

## Why Rune?

### ðŸŽ¨ Figma-to-React, minus the friction
Import your Figma designs and keep a live link while you add rich interactions. Iterate visually, push onceâ€”done.

### ðŸ”„ Visual logic, code-level power
Model state, events, and data flow in a graph interfaceâ€”Rune then generates optimized, production-ready TypeScript React components for you. Zero boilerplate, total focus on behavior.

### âš¡ Instant feedback loop
Hot-reload behaviors as you edit. Inspect state, simulate events, and iterate at the speed of thought.

### ðŸš€ Production-ready output
Rune emits idiomatic, purpose-built TypeScript components you can install via the shadcn/ui registry CLIâ€”no runtime, no lock-in.

## Made for modern product teams

- **Design Engineers** â€“ craft sophisticated interactions visually while staying inside the codebase.
- **Product Designers** â€“ prototype and validate interaction patterns without waiting on development cycles.
- **Frontend Engineers** â€“ integrate maintainable, typed components on day one.

## Stay in the loop
