AI is transforming code into a more human, intent-driven medium—an invisible layer that adapts to the way you think, feel, and build. As these tools evolve, the traditional boundaries between designers and engineers are breaking down, giving rise to a new kind of builder—someone who moves seamlessly from ideas to execution without the friction of handoffs, translation layers, or rigid silos.

The old way is dying. No more mockups thrown over walls. No more translation gaps. Just one continuous flow from thought to reality, where intent is the primary creative input.

The tools we build now will lay the foundation for this new era, and should be purpose-built—empowering creators and teams to move as fast as their ideas.

## Our Vision

A single, living canvas where product, design, and engineering collaborate in real time—producing a machine-readable spec that large language models transform directly into production software.

## Introducing Rune

How do we bring this vision to life? Rune combines the precision and design-first mindset of Figma, the interactive, node-based logic of Unreal Blueprints, and the AI-powered code generation of Cursor into a single, unified workspace.

*   **Design:** Master visual composition with intuitive vector and frame tooling, build with comprehensive component libraries, and ensure adaptability with responsive constraints. Optimized for design speed and clarity.
*   **Prototype:** Bring your designs to life with first-class logic, data, and state. Model interactions visually, similar to Unreal Blueprints, with deep integration for real-time iteration and feedback.
*   **Build:** Seamlessly transition from intent to implementation with LLM-powered code generation. Transform your high-level designs and prototypes into production-ready software, effortlessly.

Together, these capabilities create a true source of truth for modern software, eliminating handoffs and bridging the gap between design and production code.

## Why Now?

The convergence of several key trends makes this the perfect moment for Rune:

*   **AI Alignment with Human Intent:** Large Language Models can write high-quality code but require structured, clear intent—which Rune provides.
*   **Declarative Momentum:** Modern UI frameworks like React, SwiftUI, and Jetpack Compose are increasingly declarative, a style that maps cleanly to visual tooling and AI generation.
*   **Remote-First Collaboration:** Distributed teams need a living source of truth that outpaces static design files and outdated documentation. Rune is built for real-time, collaborative workflows.
