The creative platform for modern software
You're stuck in an endless prompt-and-correct loop. When you show AI your Figma designs through screenshots, you're stuck in a frustrating cycle: describe what you meant, correct AI's assumptions, explain again, and repeat. Each text chat loses more context, until you're spending more time explaining than creating.

Your creativity speaks a richer language. Every Figma file contains a complete vocabulary of components, styles, relationships, and creative decisions. But instead of bringing your vision to life, you're stuck writing chat messages about it - like a painter forced to describe their art through text instead of picking up a brush.

Rune sets you free
Rune combines an infinite canvas, Figma design import, visual programming, and AI code generation into one platform where everyone speaks the same creative language.

Your Figma designs flow directly into the canvas as living software. Add behaviors through direct manipulation. Express logic visually. Ship production-ready applications that are exactly what you imagined - no translations needed.

Pull from Figma
Import your entire design vocabulary - components, styles, relationships, - as structured data with pixel-perfect fidelity. No explanation or guesswork.

Add Rich Interactions and Data
Express interactions in Rune's native visual language. Add animations, transitions, and data flows through direct manipulation - as natural as sketching.

Get Production-Ready Code
Rune ships your complete system as production-ready code that captures your vision perfectly. Intent to reality in one unified experience.
